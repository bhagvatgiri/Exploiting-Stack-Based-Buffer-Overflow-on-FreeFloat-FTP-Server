# Exploiting-Stack-Based-Buffer-Overflow-on-FreeFloat-FTP-Server
<h1 align="center">Scope of Project and goal</h1>

- Here We are trying to exploit Freefloat FTP server running on the windows 10.

- This projectâ€™s goal is to exploit this vulnerability by over-sizing the username
variable and spawning a shell during the connection process to an ftp server. This
shell will be generated with the help of metasploit and analysing the bad characters
available in the code.

- In usual condition we planned to do this project on virtual machine with
Windows-xp sp3 machine running on it,but our virtual machine was not responding
to bridged connection and because of that our python code was not getting any
response from the ftp server.That is why we decided to shift to windows 10.

<h3>Please Check Stack-based buffer overflow on FreeFloat FTP server running.pptx, all the things are explained there. Also do check out the video, video contains the thought process behind every steps and how we achieved our goal.</h3>
